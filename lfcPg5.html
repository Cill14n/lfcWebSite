    <h1>The History of Liverpool Football Club</h1>
    <div class = "intro">
    <h2>The Club's Introduction Story</h2>
    <p>Liverpool Football Club was founded in 1892, following a dispute between the Everton Football Club committee and John Houlding, the owner of the land at Anfield where Everton played. Houlding formed a new club and named it Liverpool, after the city in which it was based. Liverpool's first season was played in the Lancashire League, and they were promoted to the Second Division of the Football League in 1893.</p>

	Liverpool Football Club's first ever match took place on September 1, 1892, against Rotherham Town at Anfield Stadium in Liverpool, England. The game was a friendly match, and Liverpool won 7-1. The team was made up of a mix of local talent and players from Scotland.</p>

	<p>Malcolm McVean(bottom row, from the right), who had been signed from Scottish club Renton, scored Liverpool's first-ever goal just a few minutes into the match.</p> 
	
	<p>	Liverpool's captain, John Houlding, was the club's founder and owner of Anfield Stadium. The team's success on the pitch in their early years led to their admission to the Football League in 1893. Below we have a video summary of the famous first match</p>

    <h1><Strong>The 2019/2020 Season</Strong></h1>
	<p>Liverpool's Premier League winning season of 2019-20 was a historic campaign for the club. The team, managed by Jurgen Klopp, dominated the league and clinched their first top-flight title in 30 years.</p>

	<p>Liverpool started the season with a run of victories, establishing an early lead at the top of the table. Key players such as Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane, and Virgil van Dijk were in excellent form, and the team's high-intensity playing style proved too much for many of their opponents.</p>

	<p>Despite a mid-season dip in form, Liverpool bounced back to secure the title with seven games remaining. The team finished the season with a club-record 99 points, 18 points ahead of second-placed Manchester City.</p>

	<p>The title win was the culmination of several years of hard work and investment by Liverpool, both on and off the pitch. The club's owners, Fenway Sports Group, had backed Klopp in the transfer market, allowing him to build a squad capable of competing at the highest level. The team's success was also built on a strong team ethic, with players and staff working together towards a common goal.</p>
