      <h2>Jürgen Klopp's Arsenal preview: 'We have to push the train and keep going'</h2>
      <p>The Reds return to their home ground on Sunday afternoon for the first time in more than a month as the current Premier League leaders arrive for a 4.30pm BST kick-off. 

		To preview the encounter, Klopp held a press conference at the AXA Training Centre on Friday morning – read on for a summary of what he had to say...

		It's obvious it's a different team, clear. Mikel is building this team for a few years now and obviously the outcome is pretty impressive. The way they play is fun to watch, to be honest, it's super-lively, really good football, top players on the pitch, good match plans. Good. It's not exactly what you can say about us in the moment, so that shows you what the situation is. But at least for a while we can mention, again, it's Anfield. So, we are at home and still have to show reaction after reaction after reaction – we have to – and improvement. That's what we will absolutely try on Sunday.

      <h2>Liverpool's injury list, suspensions and availability</h2>
      <p>Injuries

<ul><strong>Luis Diaz</strong>

    <p>Luis Diaz has made a return to training, having been absent since October with a knee injury. Jürgen Klopp on April 7th said that the plan with Luis is that he will be available 100 per cent for Leeds, but they have to be careful.</p>
</ul>

<ul><strong>Naby Keita</strong>

<p>The No.8 is sidelined with a muscle issue he picked up while on international duty with Guinea.</p>

<p>Klopp on March 31: "Naby is out, he came back with a muscle injury from the national team. We will see how long it takes but obviously the season is not too long anymore. There is a chance that Naby comes back but we have to wait a little bit."</p>
</ul>
<ul><strong>Thiago Alcantara</strong>

<p>Thiago is edging closer to a return to action as he recovers from a hip injury.</p>

<p>Klopp on April 7: "He was not out that long, trained now three, four times with the team and might be available [versus Arsenal]. But we have to check how he feels today."</p>
</ul>
<ul><strong>Stefan Bajcetic</strong>

<p>Bajcetic is currently sidelined as he receives treatment for a stress response in the adductor area.

Bajcetic on social media on March 16: "Unfortunately I've picked up an injury that will keep me out until the end of the season. It's very sad to say goodbye to this amazing season for me but I understand this is part of football and will only make me stronger physically and mentally."</p>
</ul>
<ul><strong>Calvin Ramsay</strong>

<p>Ramsay will miss the remainder of the 2022-23 season after undergoing knee surgery.

Klopp on February 17: "Even if you could come back a bit earlier, that makes no sense because now it is really to build the boy up physically and then to have a new start and we go again."</p>
</ul>
<ul><strong>Suspensions</strong>
<p>No Liverpool players are currently suspended.</p> </ul>

      <h2>U18s match report: Ranel Young strikes twice as Reds beat Newcastle</h2>
      <p>Liverpool U18s earned a 4-0 victory over Newcastle United in U18 Premier League North on Tuesday lunchtime.

Jayden Danns opened the scoring with a header and a second-half double from substitute Ranel Young, along with a low strike from Afolami Onanuga, earned a deserved win in the north east.

The game began in windy conditions at the Newcastle Academy, with both sides battling to dominate early possession.

Liverpool edged the attacking play with Francis Gyimah and Lewis Koumas causing the hosts problems down the left flank.

The Reds full-back first swung a low ball into the area, which evaded the forward by a matter of inches, leaving home stopper Adam Harrison to punch the loose ball away.

Gyimah then attempted to get in behind the Newcastle defence himself in a role reversal, as Koumas played in the defender with a clever pass.

It was Danns, though, who enjoyed the first clear-cut opportunity of the game, sliding inside the six-yard box to meet a Gyimah ball at the back post.

His effort was initially beaten away by the diving Harrison, causing a scramble in the area before the referee’s whistle halted play.

Danns did eventually break the deadlock ahead of the half-time interval, as he darted onto the end of a James McConnell corner ball to fire home a well-placed header into the net.

In the final action of the opening period, Liverpool goalkeeper Luke Hewitson was forced into his first meaningful save of the match, meeting the forward run of Shaun Mavididi to close the angle inside the box.
